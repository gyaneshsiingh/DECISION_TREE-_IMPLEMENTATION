# ðŸ“Š Decision Tree Classification (Iris Dataset)

This notebook demonstrates how to build and visualize a Decision Tree classifier using **scikit-learn**. It uses the classic **Iris dataset** which contains features of iris flowers and predicts their species.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used:
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`, `plot_tree`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Included:
- Data loading & train-test split
- Model training and prediction
- Accuracy and classification report
- Confusion matrix and tree visualization
